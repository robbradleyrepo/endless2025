- removing any old code from previous updates over the years we don't want
- split up the codebase into modules or chunks, meaning updates in future will take less time moving ahead
- use the opportunity to optimise pages for SEO (we didn't really do that before i just remembered)
- customise meta tags for each individual page - at the moment all pages use same meta tags - not a problem but google does like precision and accuracy on a page by page basis. when their bots evaluate sites during indexing, all these things help rankings.

also some amends

- slight tweak to layout to subscribe page - see attached, i think this looks better.
- remove "basic site" button option on splash page - we don't need this anymore, difference is negligible with last update. we only whacked it in on prev updates because of autoplay / audio / video browser restrictions.
- update copyright to 2025

let me know what you think, around the £250-£300 mark for all this
